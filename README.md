ROLL THE DICE APPLICATION:

This is a simple application I have created,
where the click of a HTML/CSS 'ROLL' button
will change the the numerical value of
the outfacing side of two different dice.

On-Click there is the illusion of a brief
spinning animation and the sound of the
dice being rolled across a hard surface.

The total sum of the two dice is displayed
in a subheading after each roll.
